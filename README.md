# MetricMate: SciVal Natural Language Interface
Integrating generative AI into Scival product suite by introducing a natural language understanding interface. This integration allows users to interact with Scival echosystem intuitively, asking questions and receiving contextual responses.

## The Opportunity
One of the challenges in accessing specific research metrics in SciVal is understanding how to navigate its UI. Our SciVal Assistant simplifies this process by providing a conversational interface. Users can ask questions in natural language and receive relevant metrics from Scival without dealing with the complexities of the application. The SciVal Language Interface is designed to interpret users' natural language queries, clarify ambiguity, convert them into SciVal (API) queries, and offer alternative methods to refine and answer the same question.

## Key Advantages
1. Intuitive Access: 
Users can interact naturally, initiating queries with questions, enhancing the accessibility of research metrics.

2. Increased User Engagement: 
The natural language interface boosts user engagement, providing a user-friendly interaction experience.

3. Disambiguation: 
The system can disambiguate vague or unclear user queries, ensuring accurate and relevant results.

4. Smart Suggestions: 
Intelligent suggestions based on existing Scival information guide users effectively, improving their search experience.

5. Simplified Usage: 
Users effortlessly access specific, pertinent metrics from the Scival page, saving time and effort.

6. Enhanced Relevance: 
Natural language queries result in targeted and relevant metrics, ensuring users obtain precise information.

## How It Works
**User Input**: Users ask questions in natural language regarding research metrics.

**Processing**: The SciVal Language Interface interprets the query, clarifies ambiguity, and converts it into a SciVal Page.

**Data Retrieval**: Relevant metrics are fetched from Scival based on the processed query.

**User Output**: Users receive accurate and targeted metrics directly from the SciVal page.
